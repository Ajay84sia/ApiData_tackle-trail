      "description": "Our recrafted Offshore Angler® Inshore Extreme Baitcast Reel is exceptionally light and compact, so it balances perfectly on a premium inshore rod and is a joy to palm, yet all aspects of its performance—the features serious inshore fisherman love most about this reel—remain intact. As always, we build the Inshore Extreme to fit the way tournament anglers fish. From its 1-piece machined-aluminum frame and double-anodized, machined-aluminum drilled spool, to its Recurve handle and drag star, this low-profile baitcaster's design is sleek, light and functional. The frame has 3 built-in drain holes, so your washdown water can drain and dry following the rinse. All additional features are geared for performance, including the quality 7-bearing system with 3 corrosion-resistant bearings in strategic locations, plus Powerlock™ instant anti-reverse; our Dual Braking System™, with click-adjustable magnetic and 6-pin centrifugal cast control systems working in concert; the hard titanium-coated line guide. You'll especially like the pin-release sideplate that enables you to make lightning-quick brake adjustments on the fly, the satisfying feel of the Soft Touch thumb bar, and the built-in lube port for those pre-outing touch-ups. When you're ready to reload your best rods, odds are that the lightweight, incredibly compact Offshore Angler Inshore Extreme will more than fill the bill for you."

Berkley has effectively bridged the gap between live and artificial baits with the Gulp! baits. Gulp! baits are very similar in texture and chemical potency to live bait, but have all the shape, action, and color advantages of soft plastics. Gulp! actually releases 400 times times faster than equivalent plastic baits with a scent trail so intense, fish sense it from much farther away. And it's 100% biodegradable!"

The Signal has some of the standard Leatherman multi-tool features including the iconic wire-cutting, needle-nose pliers, along with some important tools for spending an unexpected night in the woods. A fire-starting ferro rod enables you to do one of the most important tasks in outdoor survival—start a fire! And, you can signal for help without relying on battery-powered technology with the included emergency whistle. Black DLC (Diamond-Like Coating) on all tool surfaces gives them outstanding scratch and corrosion resistance; and the main frame features an exclusive Coyote Tan finish. The main knife blade has a combo edge, and is made of heat-treated, high-carbon 420 stainless steel that holds an edge through punishing use, and the blade's thumb hole allows 1-hand opening. Frame locks prevent the saw and knife blades from closing on the user's hand during hard work. The Leatherman Signal Multi-Tool also includes the following tools: diamond-coated sharpener, awl w/thread loop, can opener, bottle opener, hammer, 1/4 bit driver, carabiner, and replaceable wire cutting blades. A removable pocket clip and carabiner provide versatile options for carry. Blade Length: 2.73. Closed Length: 4.5. Weight: 7.5 oz. Mfrs.",

The 3-sided sharpening rod, the TRI-BRASIVE™ system, features 3 rotating sides with different levels of abrasives. The coarse-grit, monocrystalline diamond plate is able to bring damaged and extra dull edges back to life. The fine-grit diamond plate can re-sharpen and restore your used blade edges. The third side, a fine-grit ceramic stone, tops off your blade with an incredibly keen, burr-free, razor-sharp finish. No water or oil is needed, for quick and easy blade-sharpening tasks. Rods easily rotate for quick indexing between grits. This system adjusts to 15°, 17.5°, 20°, 22.5°, and 25° angles. It also folds down for storage inside of a compact and portable case. Since its beginnings in 2006, Work Sharp has been providing sharpening innovation at an honest value, and the Benchtop Angle Set Knife Sharpener is no different.",
