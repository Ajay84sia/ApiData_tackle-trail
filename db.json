      "description": "Our recrafted Offshore Angler® Inshore Extreme Baitcast Reel is exceptionally light and compact, so it balances perfectly on a premium inshore rod and is a joy to palm, yet all aspects of its performance—the features serious inshore fisherman love most about this reel—remain intact. As always, we build the Inshore Extreme to fit the way tournament anglers fish. From its 1-piece machined-aluminum frame and double-anodized, machined-aluminum drilled spool, to its Recurve handle and drag star, this low-profile baitcaster's design is sleek, light and functional. The frame has 3 built-in drain holes, so your washdown water can drain and dry following the rinse. All additional features are geared for performance, including the quality 7-bearing system with 3 corrosion-resistant bearings in strategic locations, plus Powerlock™ instant anti-reverse; our Dual Braking System™, with click-adjustable magnetic and 6-pin centrifugal cast control systems working in concert; the hard titanium-coated line guide. You'll especially like the pin-release sideplate that enables you to make lightning-quick brake adjustments on the fly, the satisfying feel of the Soft Touch thumb bar, and the built-in lube port for those pre-outing touch-ups. When you're ready to reload your best rods, odds are that the lightweight, incredibly compact Offshore Angler Inshore Extreme will more than fill the bill for you."

Berkley has effectively bridged the gap between live and artificial baits with the Gulp! baits. Gulp! baits are very similar in texture and chemical potency to live bait, but have all the shape, action, and color advantages of soft plastics. Gulp! actually releases 400 times times faster than equivalent plastic baits with a scent trail so intense, fish sense it from much farther away. And it's 100% biodegradable!"
